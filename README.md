# PROCSIM

PROC(ess)SIM(ulator) is a projects and threads simulator that simulates the behaviour of basic operating system scheduler. This project will involve managing processes, creatind and scheduling threads, and simple memory management.

## Objectives
1. Process creation and management: Implement functionalities to create and manage and terminate processes.
2. Thread creation and scheduling: Implement thread creation and scheduling algorithms like round robin and priority scheduling.
3. Context switching: Implement context switching between threads and saving and restoring thread state during context switching.
4. Memory management: Implement memory management functionalities like memory allocation and deallocation.
5. Memory protection: Implement memory protection functionalities like memory protection and memory access violation.
6. Inter-process communication: Implement inter-process communication functionalities like shared memory and message passing.
7. Error handling: Implement error handling functionalities like error detection and error recovery.


## Language, tools and Paradigm
This project is written in C++ and follows the object-oriented programming paradigm. Why? Because I have a subject called Object Oriented Programming with C++ in my current semester. Oh, and I've also decided to use CMake for this project. Why? Because I have a subject called Software Engineering with CMake in my current semester. I'm just kidding. That joke was written by copilot. So if you don't find it funny take it up with microsoft.
